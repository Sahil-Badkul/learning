# 📚 Personal Data Stack Notes

Welcome to my digital notebook! This repository is where I document my journey of learning and growing in the world of data and analytics.

## 🚀 What's Inside

I'm continuously expanding this collection of notes, currently covering:

- **PySpark** 🔥 — working with big data using Spark’s Python API
- **Pandas** 🐼 — data wrangling and analysis in Python
- **SQL** 🧠 — querying and manipulating structured data
- **dbt (Data Build Tool)** 🛠️ — transforming data in the modern data stack

And much more to come!

## 🌱 Why This Repo?

I believe in **learning out loud** — writing things down to truly understand them, and sharing that knowledge to help others (and future me!).

This repo is:

- A place to **consolidate my learnings**
- A way to **track my progress over time**
- A reference I can revisit whenever needed
- An open resource for anyone on a similar path
